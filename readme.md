# Instagram Clone App

Instagram Clone App w/ React Native

### About

In this application, I've built a simple version of Instagram's Feed

### Libs

- React Navigation :fireworks:

With react-navigation we can use a Stack Navigator, for transitioning our app screens, straight out the box

- Styled Components :nail_care:

CSS in JS = :heart:
Creating reusable component across our app, will make things easier

- Json Server :page_with_curl:

With json-server we can have a REST API with some mockup data, just by typing 2 commands
